NodeJS application to extract the metadata from the PDFs in the thesis of Matthias Goll at http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/17203
To regenerate: put the files in this folder to the root folder of the extracted thesis archive, so that there are the folders ref and text.
Then run npm install and nodejs index.js and wait for it to finish. Data is then stored in data.json.
